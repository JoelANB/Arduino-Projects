# Project Summary

This script works with an Arduino UNO to read a person's pulse rate (primarily at the finger).
It then flashes an LED to mimic the pulse data just received. Finally, heart rate is collected 
from the obtained data and message about whether the pulse rate is within normal resting range is
both printed and played on audio using text to speech via the laptop/computer speakers.
