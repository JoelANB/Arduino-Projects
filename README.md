# Arduino-Projects
This is a repository of projects using an Arduino and Python. These were used as practice projects in preparation for teaching at the Timothy Smith Network's (TSN's) Boston Design Academy 2023. See [here](https://laidlawscholars.network/videos/leadership-in-action-video-my-time-with-tsn) for more about my experience with TSN.
